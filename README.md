# ESMStabP: Protein Thermostability Prediction Model

ESMStabP is a protein thermostability model that leverages the embeddings generated by the ESM2 language model to predict thermostability with high accuracy. Below, we present the evaluation metrics of the model.

## Model Performance

| Model       | RÂ²     | PCC    | MAE   | MSE   | RMSE  |
|-------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| ESMStabP    | 0.95   | 0.97   | 3.45  | 19.66 | 4.43  |

## Repository Structure

### 1. `Datasets/`
This folder contains the root datasets used for training, testing, and validation:
- `Base.csv`: Entire dataset used for training.
- `Balanced.csv`: A balanced dataset with an equal number of thermophilic and non-thermophilic proteins, randomly sampled from `Base.csv`.

### 2. `Embeddings/`
This folder contains the output embeddings from the extact_embeddings() method

### 3. `Web Interface/`
This folder contains the files necessary to run the model locally using a Flask web interface.
- `app.py`: Flask application file to serve the model.
- `helper.py`: Helper methods utilized by `app.py`.
- `index.html`: Frontend interface returned by the Flask endpoint in `app.py`.

### 4. `train.py`
This file is used for training the ESMStabP model. The repository includes four pretrained models that can be used depending on the available input parameters.

### 5. `Models/`
This folder contains the output destination of trina.py
